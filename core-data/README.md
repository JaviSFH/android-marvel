# Core Data module

This module is an android library (`com.android.library`) which acts as repository for the whole app. It could be 
divided in multiple modules or even include its logic within the corresponding `feature-foo` module. Nonetheless the 
most common scenario would be that multiple `feature-foo` modules require to ask for the same data to the same data 
sources, so with this approach the logic is easily shared across the `feature-foo` modules.
